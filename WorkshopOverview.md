## Workshop Objectives

Participants will work collaboratively in teams to:

* Enhance leadership skills including strategic decision-making, effective communication, and collaborative problem-solving.
* Assemble and program the **MasterPi robot**, a sophisticated mobile platform with advanced robotics capabilities:

  * **Mecanum wheels** for omni-directional and precision mobility.
  * A versatile **robotic arm** with gripper capability for object manipulation.
  * An integrated **camera system** to identify, interpret, and respond to AprilTags for accurate navigation.
* Utilize the **Raspberry Pi 500 (Pi500)** as a centralized control station to code, debug, monitor, and optimize robot performance in real-time.

## Workshop Phases

The workshop is carefully structured into three interactive phases:

### Phase 1: Robot Assembly

* Teams will collaboratively assemble the MasterPi robot using detailed instructions and comprehensive kits.
* Key components such as mecanum wheels, robotic arm, camera module, and internal electronics will be installed and configured.

### Phase 2: Robot Capabilities Exploration

* Participants will explore and familiarize themselves with robot operations through provided Python-based scripts.
* Activities will include:

  * Precise control of mecanum wheels for omni-directional driving.
  * Operating the robotic arm for object pickup and manipulation.
  * Using the onboard camera to detect, analyze, and respond to AprilTags for navigation.
* Teams will systematically test these capabilities to build operational proficiency and confidence.

### Phase 3: Obstacle Course Navigation Challenge

* Teams will apply their knowledge and skills to navigate an obstacle course strategically placed with AprilTags.
* This culminating challenge requires teams to:

  * Accurately detect and interpret AprilTags for strategic navigation.
  * Position the robot precisely relative to each tag, demonstrating both accuracy and agility.
  * Successfully perform interaction tasks, such as manipulating objects with the robotic arm.
