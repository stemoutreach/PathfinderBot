# PathfinderBot Workshop Overview

Welcome to the **PathfinderBot** workshop! This hands-on experience is designed for engineering-minded teams to build, program, and operate an autonomous robot capable of navigating an obstacle course using visual markers called **AprilTags**.

## Workshop Objective

Participants will work in teams to assemble and operate the **MasterPi robot**, which features:

* **Mecanum wheels** for omni-directional movement
* A **robotic arm** with a gripper for interacting with objects
* A **camera** used for AprilTag detection and navigation

Teams will use the **Raspberry Pi 500** (Pi500) as a command and monitoring station. The Pi500 connects wirelessly to the MasterPi robot via Wi-Fi, enabling control, programming, and real-time feedback.

## How It Works

The workshop is divided into three main phases:

### 1. Assemble the Robot

* Teams begin by physically assembling the MasterPi robot using the provided kits.
* Key systems such as the mecanum drive, robotic arm, and camera are mounted and connected.

### 2. Learn the Robot Capabilities

* Teams explore the preloaded Python-based control scripts.
* You will:

  * Drive using mecanum wheels
  * Operate the arm and gripper
  * Use the camera to detect AprilTags and estimate position
* Each feature will be tested in a controlled environment to build confidence.

### 3. Navigate the Course

* The final challenge involves navigating a course using AprilTags as waypoints.
* Teams will:

  * Detect AprilTags using the onboard camera
  * Center the robot on the tag
  * Move to a defined position relative to each tag
  * Interact with objects if needed (e.g., pick up a block)

## The System: Pi500 + MasterPi

* The **MasterPi robot** is the mobile unit with computing and sensing capabilities.
* The **Pi500** is the team interface â€” used for coding, debugging, and monitoring.
* Both devices are networked via a local Wi-Fi connection for remote control and file sharing.

## Workshop Goals

* Build team collaboration through shared problem-solving
* Explore robotics principles including mobility, sensing, and control
* Experience real-world engineering workflows in a fun and engaging format

Let's build, explore, and navigate!
