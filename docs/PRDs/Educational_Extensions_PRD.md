2. **Engagement**: Student engagement time should increase by at least 25% compared to traditional robotics education.
3. **Concept Mastery**: Assessments should show at least 20% improvement in concept understanding.
4. **Instructor Adoption**: Resources should reduce instructor preparation time by at least 40%.
5. **Accessibility**: Students without prior programming experience should be able to complete basic tasks within the first session.
6. **Progression**: 80% of beginners should be able to advance to intermediate level within a semester course.

## Educational Impact

The educational extensions will enable the PathfinderBot to effectively teach:
- Fundamental programming concepts
