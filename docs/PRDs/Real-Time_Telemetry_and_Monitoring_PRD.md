PathfinderBot Real-Time Telemetry and Monitoring PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the real-time telemetry, monitoring, and diagnostic capabilities of the PathfinderBot platform. These improvements will provide better visibility into the robot's operation, enable predictive maintenance, facilitate debugging, and enhance the overall educational experience through interactive data visualization.

## Current State Analysis

Currently, the PathfinderBot has basic telemetry capabilities with limitations:
