# PathfinderBot Testing and Reliability PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the testing, reliability, and diagnostic capabilities of the PathfinderBot platform. These improvements aim to create a more robust system that can operate dependably in educational environments, recover gracefully from errors, and provide clear diagnostic information when issues arise.

## Current State Analysis

Currently, the PathfinderBot platform has several limitations in testing and reliability:
- Limited automated testing infrastructure
- Inconsistent error handling across modules
- Minimal diagnostic capabilities when issues occur
- No formalized quality assurance process
- Limited telemetry for post-session analysis
- Inadequate battery monitoring and safe shutdown
- Few self-test capabilities for hardware components
- Lack of comprehensive logging framework

These limitations can lead to unexpected failures during educational activities, reducing the platform's effectiveness as a teaching tool.
