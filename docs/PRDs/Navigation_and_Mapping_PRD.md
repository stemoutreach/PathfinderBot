# PathfinderBot Navigation and Mapping System PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing advanced navigation and mapping capabilities for the PathfinderBot. The enhancements will enable the robot to create and maintain maps of its environment, localize itself within those maps, and navigate efficiently between locations.

## Current State Analysis

Currently, the PathfinderBot has basic navigation capabilities:
- Simple movement commands (forward, backward, rotation)
- AprilTag detection for basic localization
- Sonar-based obstacle detection
- Manual navigation via web interface

These capabilities are suitable for basic operation but lack the sophistication needed for autonomous navigation and environmental understanding.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. SLAM Implementation

#### 1.1 Environmental Mapping
- Develop a 2D occupancy grid map representation
- Implement map updating based on sensor data
- Create persistence mechanism to save and load maps
- Develop map visualization tools for the web interface

#### 1.2 Localization
- Implement particle filter localization
- Fuse data from multiple sensors (camera, sonar, wheel encoders)
- Handle dynamic obstacles and environmental changes
- Implement loop closure detection for map correction

#### 1.3 Path Planning
- Implement A* or RRT* algorithm for global path planning
- Develop local planning for obstacle avoidance
- Create a waypoint navigation system
- Implement path smoothing for more natural movement

### 2. Sensor Integration

#### 2.1 Enhanced Camera Usage
- Implement feature extraction for visual SLAM
- Create depth estimation from monocular camera
- Enable visual odometry for improved position tracking
- Optimize AprilTag detection for mapping landmarks

#### 2.2 Additional Sensors
- Integrate wheel encoders for odometry
- Improve sonar usage for obstacle detection
- Add option for additional distance sensors (ToF, IR)
- Implement sensor fusion algorithms

### 3. Navigation Behaviors

#### 3.1 Autonomous Navigation
- Create a goal-seeking behavior
- Implement exploration mode for unknown environments
- Develop return-to-home functionality
- Add patrol routes along defined paths

#### 3.2 Obstacle Handling
- Implement dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Create recovery behaviors for navigation failures
- Develop strategies for narrow passages
- Add special handling for moving obstacles

### 4. User Interface

#### 4.1 Map Visualization
- Create interactive map display in web interface
- Add real-time position tracking visualization
- Implement tools for map editing and annotation
- Develop map layer system (obstacles, free space, custom annotations)

#### 4.2 Navigation Controls
- Create interface for setting navigation goals
- Develop waypoint management system
- Implement path visualization and editing
- Add navigation status monitoring

## Implementation Priority and Timeline

### Phase 1 (1-2 months)
- Basic SLAM implementation with occupancy grid mapping
- Simple localization using existing sensors
- Integration of wheel encoders for odometry
- Map visualization in web interface

### Phase 2 (2-3 months)
- Enhanced localization with sensor fusion
- Path planning algorithms
- Basic autonomous navigation behaviors
- Map persistence and management

### Phase 3 (3-4 months)
- Advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Complete navigation behavior suite
- Enhanced user interface for navigation control
- Performance optimization and robustness improvements

## Success Metrics

1. **Mapping Accuracy**: Maps should represent the environment with at least 90% accuracy compared to ground truth.
2. **Localization Precision**: Position error should be less than 5cm in mapped environments.
3. **Navigation Reliability**: Successful navigation to goals at least 95% of the time in mapped environments.
4. **Path Efficiency**: Routes taken should be within 20% of the optimal path length.
5. **Real-time Performance**: All processing should maintain the control loop at minimum 10Hz on the target hardware.
6. **User Experience**: Navigation controls should be intuitive enough for new users to set goals within 5 minutes of introduction.

## Conclusion

The implementation of these navigation and mapping capabilities will significantly enhance the PathfinderBot's autonomy and utility. It will enable more sophisticated demonstrations and educational scenarios, particularly in robotics courses covering SLAM, path planning, and autonomous systems.
