## Workshop Goals

* **Leadership Development**: Strengthen strategic thinking, decision-making, and communication skills.
* **Hands-On Robotics Experience**: Assemble, program, and operate a robot using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and AprilTags.
* **Team Collaboration**: Work effectively in groups to complete challenges and navigate obstacle courses.

## Workshop Workflow and Getting Started

Each team will be provided with a Raspberry Pi 500, a portable monitor, and a robot kit. The Raspberry Pi 500 and the portable monitor serve dual purposes:

* **Initial Setup Desktop:** Access assembly instructions and resources from GitHub.
* **Robot Control Interface:** Connect to the robot via SSH and VNC for testing and operation.
