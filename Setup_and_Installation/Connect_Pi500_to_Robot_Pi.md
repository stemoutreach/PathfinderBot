# **Connecting and Testing Instructions**

## Prerequisites:

1. Robot is on and you have the robot's current IP (shown below as XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)
1. Pi500 is connected to monitor, mouse and powered on

## Steps: from the Raspberry Pi 500

1. **SSH Connection**

    Open a terminal and enter the following command replacing the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with the robot's IP
    - NOTE: Username = robot. default Password was R4spb3rry
            
    ~~~
    ssh robot@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    ~~~

1. **Start Robot - initualizes the robot and sets the arm to starting position [pf_start_robot.py](/code/pf_start_robot.py)**
             
   ~~~
   cd /home/robot/code
   sudo python pf_start_robot.py
   ~~~

1. **Test arm servo connections [pf_test_arm_servos.py](/code/pf_test_arm_servos.py)**

   The following script will move each servo a little starting with the claw. Check to make sure all servos are plugged into the correct location.  

    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python pf_test_arm_servos.py
    ~~~

1. **Test motor connections [pf_test_motors.py](/code/pf_test_motors.py)**

   The following script will move each motor to test that the motors are plugged into the correct location. The wheels will run in the following order:
   
   - left front
   - right front
   - left back
   - right back  
          

    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python pf_test_motors.py
    ~~~

1. **Demo robot drive movements [pf_demo_drive_movements.py](/code/pf_demo_drive_movements.py)**

   Place the robot on the floor before continuing.  The robot will move in the following order:
         
   - Forward
   - Reverse
   - StrafeRight
   - StrafeLeft
   - TurnRight
   - TurnLeft

           
    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python pf_demo_drive_movements.py
    ~~~

1. **Demo arm picking up a block and loading it onto its back [pf_demo_arm_pickup_movements.py](/code/pf_demo_arm_pickup_movements.py)**

   Place the robot on the floor and set a block in front of the robot.

    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python pf_demo_arm_pickup_movements.py
    ~~~


1. **Demo the camera and control the robot through a simple web interface [pf_demo_web_drive.py](/code/pf_demo_web_drive.py)** 

   Place the robot on the floor and set a block in front of the robot. 

    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python pf_demo_web_drive.py
    ~~~

    | ‚ü≥              | Turn right           |
    | ‚ñ†              | Stop all movement    |

    üåÄ Speed Sliders

    - **Move Speed** ‚Äì Forward/backward/strafe (10‚Äì100 mm/s)
    - **Turn Speed** ‚Äì Rotational speed (mapped to radians/sec using a scaling factor)
    
    Changes are applied via JavaScript fetch calls next time the button is pressed.
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Setting movement or turn speed to high values (near 100) may cause the robot to respond sluggishly or make the web interface temporarily unresponsive to commands like Stop. Reduce speeds for better responsiveness and control during testing. 





# **Optional - How to remote connect to the Robot Pi if needed**


1. **VNC Connection**

    Launch RealVNC Viewer
   
     <img src="/zzimages/RealVNCViewer.jpg" width="200" > 

     <img src="/zzimages/VNC.jpg" width="200" > 

     <img src="/zzimages/VNC1.jpg" width="200" > 

     <img src="/zzimages/VNC2.jpg" width="200" > 

    Input the robots IP XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX to connect. Username = robot. default Password was R4spb3rry

1. **Run Camera test within the VNC viewer**
 
    If picture is black, then remove the lens cap
   
    If the picture is out of focus, turn the camea lense left or right to focus.
   
    ~~~
    cd /home/robot/code
    sudo python Camera.py
    ~~~

1. **Calibrate servos within the VNC viewer**
  
    Calibrate may be needed based on the start up position of the robot arm in step 2 above. Normal start up position for the arm should look like the picture below.
   
   <img src="/zzimages/ArmStartUp.jpeg" width="200" > 

    If the start up position is not the same, the servo positions will need to be corrected or a servo may need to be replaced. The Arm.py program is a way to interact with the arm and can help you fuigure out what is needed.
