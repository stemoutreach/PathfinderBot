# PathfinderBot Workshop

**Empowering Engineers Through Hands-On Robotics and Leadership Development**

Welcome to the **PathfinderBot** repository! This project is specifically designed for engineers and technical teams. Participants will engage in practical robot assembly, coding, and problem-solving exercises aimed at fostering leadership, teamwork, and technical innovation.

## Workshop Goals

* **Leadership Development**: Strengthen strategic thinking, decision-making, and communication skills.
* **Hands-On Robotics Experience**: Assemble, program, and operate a robot using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and AprilTags.
* **Team Collaboration**: Work effectively in groups to complete challenges and navigate obstacle courses.


## Team Roles

Each team will consist of 3 members, each with a designated role to encourage collaboration and division of responsibility:

| **Builder** | **Programmer** | **Strategist** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Assembles the robot using the provided hardware and guides | Sets up and runs the code for robot navigation, sensors, and actions | Studies the game rules and scoring, and plans the best strategy |
| Connects motors, servos, sensors, and camera | Uses sample Python scripts and modifies them to suit the challenge | Helps guide the teamâ€™s focus during the timed challenge |
| Collaborates with Programmer to test physical components | Troubleshoots and adjusts robot behaviors | Suggests design or code tweaks to optimize robot performance |
| Adds any needed attachments for carrying blocks | Works with Builder to verify motor and servo functions | Keeps the team on track and aligned to competition goals |
